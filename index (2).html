            <p class="text2"> Light was "a young man who could understand the pain of others" when he first encountered the Death Note. Ohba said that if Ryuk never developed an interest in the human world, Light would have become "one of the greatest police leaders in the world" who, with L, worked against criminals.</p>
            <p class="text2">Light starts using the Death Note with the initial goal of eliminating criminals and creating a utopian society free from wrongdoing. He believes that his actions will make the world a better place.
                God Complex:
                
                Over time, Light develops a god complex, seeing himself as a deity with the power to judge and determine who should live or die. This shift in perspective contributes to his descent into moral ambiguity.
                Strategic Mind:
                
                Light is known for his strategic thinking and ability to plan several steps ahead. His intelligence is a central aspect of the series, especially as he tries to outsmart his adversaries, including the brilliant detective L.
                Manipulative Nature:
                
                Light is adept at manipulation, using his intelligence to deceive others and maintain a facade of innocence. This manipulation extends to those close to him, including family and friends.
                Dual Identity:
                
                Light leads a double life, appearing as a diligent and highly successful student to the outside world while secretly operating as Kira. This duality adds layers to his character.
                Emotional Complexity:
                
                Despite his cold and calculated exterior, Light experiences moments of emotional turmoil and conflict, particularly as he grapples with the consequences of his actions and the pressure of being pursued by L.
                Relationship with L:
                
                The dynamic between Light and L is a central aspect of the series. Their intellectual rivalry and psychological warfare form a compelling narrative, with each trying to outwit the other.
                Loved Ones at Risk:
                
                Light's actions put not only himself but also his family and friends at risk. The series explores the impact of his choices on those close to him and how they are affected by the unfolding events.
                Confrontation with Morality:
                
                As Light continues to use the Death Note, he is forced to confront the moral implications of his actions. The series delves into the ethical dilemma of whether the end justifies the means.
                Legacy and Impact:
                
                Light Yagami's character has left a lasting impact on discussions about morality in anime and manga. The complex nature of his character and the philosophical questions raised by his story contribute to the enduring popularity of "Death Note."
